Revision history for Perl extension DBD::InterBase.

0.01  Wed Apr 26 16:45:07 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19

May 2 2001
* Fixed memory leak in bind param.

April 19 2001
* Fix to dbdimp.h by Daniel Ritz. 
* Nullify var->sqldata and tpb_buffer when cleaning up. 

April 18 2001
* Now works correctly with negative INT64 values

March 24 2001
* Added private method set_tx_param() for controlling transaction parameters
  (experimental)
* More robust execute()
* Added more tests
* Easier `make test`. Now allows user to specify test database, as well as 
  username, and password to connect. 
  The test database creation is automated, if it doesn't exist.
* Clean compile with MSVC. But in Windows, there's bug with BLOB fields.

January 22 2001
* Memory leak problem fixed
* Added Flemming's submitted patch to zero sqlda before being used.
* SQL dialect 1 now can access timestamp field. 
* Lighter, faster $dbh->ping(). I hope this is more stable, as well.

Sept 27 2000
* Replace isc_commit_retaining() with isc_commit_transaction. Flemming
suspected this as the source of some deadlock problem.
* Fixed dbd_db_rollback(). Now no longer starts a new transaction after
rollback.

Aug 30 2000
* Patch to DBI.pm of DBI-1.14, fixes a subtle bug of fetchall_arrayref().
The patched DBI allows DBD::InterBase to work with DBIx::Tree 0.91. Cool!
* Moving FAQ.pm to InterBase/FAQ.pm

Aug 28 2000
* $sth->{NAME} now return column alias, if any.

Aug 22 2000
* Fixed _OdbcParse() in InterBase.pm, to connect to remote host incl.
Windows.

Aug 19 2000
* $sth->rows() now returns the number of fetched rows, for SELECT, otherwise
returns - 1 (unknown).

Aug 18 2000
* starting a transaction (automatic or not) is more robust, now it reuses an
active transaction handle, instead of overridding it with a new one, leaving
the previous one "immortal" (because the previous transaction handle is no
longer kept!)

Aug 16 2000
* Fix $dbh->do() method for usage with placeholders.
* Added support for CursorName attrib
* more robust commit with AutoCommit on

Aug 13 2000
* Added datatype values conversion routine between InterBase internal
values and DBI/ISO/ANSI/ODBC values
* Fixed tables() method, now correctly removes the trailing blank spaces
* Tested to 100% compliant with DBIx::Recordset (0.21)!

Aug 12 2000
* more informative error message
* fix ping() method. Now not die if RaiseError => 1

July 29 2000
* AutoCommit attribute handling:

- in dbd_login6():
simply turns on imp_dbh->init_commit = 1

- in db_STORE_attrib() :
if init_commit == 1:
if AutoCommit turned On: do nothing.
if AutoCommit turned Off: start a new default transaction, stored in
imp_dbh->tr

if init_commit == 0:
if AutoCommit turned On: commit changes.
if AutoCommit turned Off: start a new default transaction, stored in 
imp_dbh->tr

Before returning, init_commit is reset to 0.
