REQUIREMENTS:
  - Perl 5.004 installed
  - Perl DBI (1.41 and higher)
  - Firebird or InterBase
  - A C compiler
    * UN*X
      GCC 2.95.2 (tested, older may or may not work) or other capable

      - Borland C++ 5.5
        You can donwload a free copy of BCC55 at
          ftp://ftpd.borland.com/download/bcppbuilder/freecommandLinetools.exe

        In order to compile with Borland compiler you need pmake:
          http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/NI-S/Make-1.00.tar.gz
        dmake would work too (building) but has problems creating PPD file
          http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/GSAR/dmake-4.1pl1-win32.zip


      - or Microsoft VC++ 6.0


*BEFORE* BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

  - Build, test and install Perl 5 (at least 5.004).
    It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

  - Build, test and install the DBI module (at least DBI 1.41).
    It is very important to TEST it and INSTALL it!

  - Remember to *read* the DBI README file!

  - Make sure that InterBase/Firebird server is running (for testing)


BUILDING:
  Win32 with Borland C++:
    type 'pmake' or 'dmake', not just 'make'. before run make: 
      perl PatchBCC

  Win32 with MS compiler:
    type 'nmake', not just 'make'


  To Configure and build the DBD:
    perl Makefile.PL
      (when asked to specify a test database, please specify a non-existing file)
    make

TESTING

  make test
  make install               (if the tests look okay)
