DBI.pm.diff is a patch for DBI-1.14 to fix $sth->fetchall_arrayref().
This is necessary if you want to use InterBase with DBIx::Tree 0.91.

-----------------
From DBI 1.14 doc:
 
When passed a hash reference, fetchall_arrayref uses
the fetchrow_hashref entry elsewhere in this
document to fetch each row as a hash reference. If the
parameter hash is not empty, then it is used as a
slice to select individual columns by name. The names
should be lower case regardless of the letter case in
$sth->{NAME}.  The values of the hash should be set to
1.                

.......
To fetch all fields of every row as a hash ref:
 
 $tbl_ary_ref = $sth->fetchall_arrayref({});

------------------

In practice, when passed an _empty_hash_ref_ as the above snippet, the
column names' letter case depend on the underlying database, in other
words, they are the same as what is stored in $sth->{NAME}.
This is incorrect for databases which use uppercase in $sth->{NAME}, such as
InterBase.
