This directory contains two example scripts that demonstrate a bug in
IBPerl.
Both scripts do exactly the same thing: connect to a test database, create a
table, commit, insert two records, commit, and drop the table.

The first script should be run to isql:
$ /path/to/your/isql < succeed.sql

This script works without problem, and then run fail.pl that uses IBPerl to
do the same thing.
