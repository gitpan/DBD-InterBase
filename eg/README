There should be a database test.gdb exists before running the 
example scripts in this directory. The database should contains an empty table 
SIMPLE.
You can use create.sql script to create it (run it from eg directory):

$ /path/to/your/isql -i create.sql

1. insert.pl - insert some records into table SIMPLE
   using: prepare,
            execute (within loop)
   with placeholders / bind values. AutoCommit on.
2. insdo.pl - insert using do() and placeholders. AutoCommit off.
3. select.pl - select and fetch the result
   using: prepare,
            execute,
            fetchrow_array
4. del.pl - delete all inserted record
   using: prepare,
            execute
