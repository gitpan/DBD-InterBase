0.20.5:
1. Test/supply test cases for AutoCommit = Off
2. implement ib_blob_read() method for piece by piece blob read.
3. Supply meaningful error code for do_error()
4. $dbh->{Name} attribute
5. examine bind_param() with type info passed.
6. execute(), do(), and rows() should return correct values upon successful
execution.
7. implement dbd_st_rows()

GENERAL:
1. Design and implementation of greater control of transaction isolation
   level.
2. Assure compliance with existing DBI extension modules, such as Tie::DBI,
   Apache::DBI, DBIx::RecordSet, etc.
3. Porting, esp to Win32 (as PPM).
4. Test: memory leaks, buffer overflow.
5. Benchmarking and code profiling.
6. Implement supports for InterBase services.
7. Create Bundle for CPAN.pm
8. Compatibility with previous InterBase (4.0 for Linux, 5.5, etc).

FUTURE:
1. Implement InterBase specific features: services, etc.

PROPOSED INTERFACE FOR ib_blob_read() method:

=item C<ib_blob_read>

Here is an example of how to use the ib_blob_read() method:

    #segment size units in Bytes
    $offset = 0;
    while(defined($sth->ib_blob_read($blob_id, $offset, $segment_sz, \$buf))) {
        print $fh $buf; # the result is stored in $buf, written to $fh
        $offset += length $buf;
    }

or, more in fetch() spirit:

    while($blob = $sth->ib_blob_read($blob_id, $offset, $segment_sz)) {
        print $fh $blob; # the result is stored in $blob, written to $fh
        $offset += length $blob;
    }

=head2 Statement Handle Attributes

=item B<ib_piecewise>

When this attribute is set to 1, a fetch from a blob field only gets the
blob ID, not the blob itself. Call blob_read() method to get the blob data.

 $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM $table", {ib_piecewise => 1});
