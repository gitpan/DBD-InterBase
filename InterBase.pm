=head1 NAME

DBD::InterBase - DBI driver for Firebird and InterBase RDBMS server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DBI;

  $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:InterBase:db=$dbname", "sysdba", "masterkey");

  # See the DBI module documentation for full details

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DBD::InterBase is a Perl module which works with the DBI module to provide
access to Firebird and InterBase databases.

=head1 MODULE DOCUMENTATION

This documentation describes driver specific behavior and restrictions. 
It is not supposed to be used as the only reference for the user. In any 
case consult the DBI documentation first !

=head1 THE DBI CLASS

=head2 DBI Class Methods

=over 4

=item B<connect>

To connect to a database with a minimum of parameters, use the 
following syntax: 

  $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:InterBase:dbname=$dbname", "sysdba", "masterkey");

This connects to the database $dbname at localhost as SYSDBA user with the
default password. 

Multiline DSN is acceptable. Here is an example of connect statement which uses all 
possible parameters: 

   $dsn =<< "DSN";
 dbi:InterBase:dbname=$dbname;
 host=$host;
 port=$port;
 ib_dialect=$dialect;
 ib_role=$role;
 ib_charset=$charset;
 ib_cache=$cache
 DSN

 $dbh =  DBI->connect($dsn, $username, $password);

The $dsn is prefixed by 'dbi:InterBase:', and consists of key-value
parameters separated by B<semicolons>. New line may be added after the
semicolon. The following is the list of valid parameters and their
respective meanings:

    parameter   meaning                             optional?
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    database    path to the database                required
    dbname      path to the database
    db          path to the database
    host        hostname (not IP address)           optional
    port        port number                         optional
    ib_dialect  the SQL dialect to be used          optional
    ib_role     the role of the user                optional
    ib_charset  character set to be used            optional
    ib_cache    number of database cache buffers    optional

B<database> could be used interchangebly with B<dbname> and B<db>. 
To connect to a remote host, use the B<host> parameter. 
Here is an example of DSN to connect to a remote Windows host:

 $dsn = "dbi:InterBase:db=C:/temp/test.gdb;host=rae.cumi.org;ib_dialect=3";

Firebird as of version 1.0 listens on port specified within the services
file. To connect to port other than the default 3050, add the port number at
the end of host name, separated by a slash. Example:

 $dsn = 'dbi:InterBase:db=/data/test.gdb;host=localhost/3060';

InterBase 6.0 introduces B<SQL dialect> to provide backward compatibility with
databases created by older versions of InterBase. In short, SQL dialect
controls how InterBase interprets:

 - double quotes
 - the DATE datatype
 - decimal and numeric datatypes
 - new 6.0 reserved keywords

Valid values for B<ib_dialect> are 1, 2, and 3. The driver's default value is
1. 

B<ib_role> specifies the role of the connecting user. B<SQL role> is
implemented by InterBase to make database administration easier when dealing
with lots of users. A detailed reading can be found at:

 http://www.ibphoenix.com/ibp_sqlroles.html

If B<ib_cache> is not specified, the default database's cache size value will be 
used. The InterBase Operation Guide discusses in full length the importance of 
this parameter to gain the best performance.

=item B<available_drivers>

  @driver_names = DBI->available_drivers;

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<data_sources>

This method is not yet implemented.

=item B<trace>

See Common Methods. 

=head1 METHODS COMMON TO ALL DBI HANDLES

=over 4

=item B<err>

  $rv = $h->err;

Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI. 

=item B<errstr>

  $str = $h->errstr;

Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI. 

=item B<state>

This method is not yet implemented.

=item B<trace>

  $h->trace($trace_level, $trace_filename);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<trace_msg>

  $h->trace_msg($message_text);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<func>

See B<Transactions> section for information about invoking C<ib_set_tx_param()>
from func() method.

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES COMMON TO ALL DBI HANDLES

=over 4

=item B<Warn> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<Active> (boolean, read-only)

Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI. A database 
handle is active while it is connected and  statement 
handle is active until it is finished. 

=item B<Kids> (integer, read-only)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<ActiveKids> (integer, read-only)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<CachedKids> (hash ref)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<CompatMode> (boolean, inherited)

Not used by this driver. 

=item B<InactiveDestroy> (boolean)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<PrintError> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<RaiseError> (boolean, inherited)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<ChopBlanks> (boolean, inherited)

=head1 DATABASE HANDLE OBJECTS

=head2 Database Handle Methods

=over 4

=item B<selectrow_array>

  @row_ary = $dbh->selectrow_array($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<selectall_arrayref>

  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectall_arrayref($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<selectcol_arrayref>

  $ary_ref = $dbh->selectcol_arrayref($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact.

=item B<prepare>

  $sth = $dbh->prepare($statement, \%attr);

Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI.
When AutoCommit is On, this method implicitly starts a new transaction,
which will be automatically committed after the following execute() or the
last fetch(), depending on the statement type. For select statements,
commit automatically takes place after the last fetch(), or by explicitly 
calling finish() method if there are any rows remaining. For non-select
statements, execute() will implicitly commits the transaction. 

=item B<prepare_cached>

  $sth = $dbh->prepare_cached($statement, \%attr);

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact. 

=item B<do>

  $rv  = $dbh->do($statement, \%attr, @bind_values);

Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI.
This should be used for non-select statements, where the driver doesn't take
the conservative prepare - execute steps, thereby speeding up the execution
time. But if this method is used with bind values, the speed advantage
diminishes as this method calls prepare() for binding the placeholders.
Instead of calling this method repeatedly with bind values, it would be
better to call prepare() once, and execute() many times.

See the notes for the execute method elsewhere in this document.

=head2 Database Handle Attributes

=over 4

=item B<AutoCommit>  (boolean)

Supported by the driver as proposed by DBI. According to the 
classification of DBI, InterBase is a database, in which a 
transaction must be explicitly started. Without starting a 
transaction, every change to the database becomes immediately 
permanent. The default of AutoCommit is on, which corresponds 
to the DBI's default. When setting AutoCommit to off, a transaction 
will be started and every commit or rollback 
will automatically start a new transaction. For details see the 
notes about B<Transactions> elsewhere in this document. 

=item B<Driver>  (handle)

Implemented by DBI, no driver-specific impact. 

=item B<Name>  (string, read-only)

Not yet implemented.

=item B<RowCacheSize>  (integer)

Implemented by DBI, not used by the driver.

=item B<ib_softcommit>  (driver-specific, boolean)

Set this attribute to TRUE to use InterBase's soft commit feature (default
to FALSE). Soft commit retains the internal transaction handle when
committing a transaction, while the default commit behavior always closes
and invalidates the transaction handle.

Since the transaction handle is still open, there is no need to start a new transaction 
upon every commit, so applications can gain performance improvement. Using soft commit is also 
desirable when dealing with nested statement handles under AutoCommit on. 

Switching the attribute's value from TRUE to FALSE will force hard commit thus 
closing the current transaction.

=head1 DRIVER SPECIFIC INFORMATION

=head2 Transactions

The transaction behavior is controlled with the attribute AutoCommit. 
For a complete definition of AutoCommit please refer to the DBI documentation. 

According to the DBI specification the default for AutoCommit is TRUE. 
In this mode, any change to the database becomes valid immediately. Any 
commit() or rollback() will be rejected. 

If AutoCommit is switched-off, immediately a transaction will be started.
A rollback() will rollback and close the active transaction, then implicitly 
start a new transaction. A disconnect will issue a rollback. 

InterBase provides fine control over transaction behavior, where users can
specify the access mode, the isolation level, the lock resolution, and the 
table reservation (for a specified table). For this purpose,
C<ib_set_tx_param()> database handle method is available. 

Upon a successful C<connect()>, these default parameter values will be used
for every SQL operation:

    Access mode:        read/write
    Isolation level:    concurrency
    Lock resolution:    wait

Any of the above value can be changed using C<ib_set_tx_param()>.

=over 4

=item B<ib_set_tx_param> 

 $dbh->func( 
    -access_mode     => 'read_write',
    -isolation_level => 'read_committed',
    -lock_resolution => 'wait',
    'ib_set_tx_param'
 );

Valid value for C<-access_mode> is C<read_write>, or C<read_only>. 
Valid value for C<-lock_resolution> is C<wait>, or C<no_wait>.
C<-isolation_level> may be: C<read_committed>, C<snapshot>,
C<snapshot_table_stability>. If C<read_committed> is to be used with
C<record_version> or C<no_record_version>, then they should be inside an
anonymous array:

 $dbh->func( 
    -isolation_level => ['read_committed', 'record_version'],
    'ib_set_tx_param'
 );

Table reservation is supported since C<DBD::InterBase 0.30>. Names of the
tables to reserve as well as their reservation params/values are specified
inside a hashref, which is then passed as the value of C<-reserving>.

The following example reserves C<foo_table> with C<read> lock and C<bar_table> 
with C<read> lock and C<protected> access:

 $dbh->func(
    -access_mode     => 'read_write',
    -isolation_level => 'read_committed',
    -lock_resolution => 'wait',
    -reserving       =>
        {
            foo_table => {
                lock    => 'read',
            },
            bar_table => {
                lock    => 'read',
                access  => 'protected',
            },
        },
    'ib_set_tx_param'
 );

Possible table reservation parameters are:

=over 4

=item C<access> (optional)

Valid values are C<shared> or C<protected>.

=item C<lock> (required)

Valid values are C<read> or C<write>.

=back

Under C<AutoCommit> mode, invoking this method doesn't only change the
transaction parameters (as with C<AutoCommit> off), but also commits the
current transaction. The new transaction parameters will be used in
any newly started transaction. 

C<ib_set_tx_param()> can also be invoked with no parameter in which it resets
transaction parameters to the default value.

=back

=head2 DATE, TIME, and TIMESTAMP Formats

C<DBD::InterBase> supports various formats for query results of DATE, TIME,
and TIMESTAMP types. 

By default, it uses "%c" for TIMESTAMP, "%x" for DATE, and "%X" for TIME,
and pass them to ANSI C's strftime() function to format your query results.
These values are respectively stored in ib_timestampformat, ib_dateformat,
and ib_timeformat attributes, and may be changed in two ways:

=over 

=item * At $dbh level

This replaces the default values. Example:

 $dbh->{ib_timestampformat} = '%m-%d-%Y %H:%M';
 $dbh->{ib_dateformat} = '%m-%d-%Y';
 $dbh->{ib_timeformat} = '%H:%M';

=item * At $sth level

This overrides the default values only for the currently prepared statement. Example:

 $attr = {
    ib_timestampformat => '%m-%d-%Y %H:%M',
    ib_dateformat => '%m-%d-%Y',
    ib_timeformat => '%H:%M',
 };
 # then, pass it to prepare() method. 
 $sth = $dbh->prepare($sql, $attr);

=back

Since locale settings affect the result of strftime(), if your application
is designed to be portable across different locales, you may consider using these
two special formats: 'TM' and 'ISO'. C<TM> returns a 9-element list, much like
Perl's localtime(). The C<ISO> format applies sprintf()'s pattern
"%04d-%02d-%02d %02d:%02d:%02d.%04d" for TIMESTAMP, "%04d-%02d-%02d" for
DATE, and "%02d:%02d:%02d.%04d" for TIME. 

C<$dbh-E<gt>{ib_time_all}> can be used to specify all of the three formats at
once. Example:

 $dbh->{ib_time_all} = 'TM';


=head2 Using Event Alerter

This new feature is experimental and subjects to change. 

=over

=item C<ib_init_event>

 $evh = $dbh->func(@event_names, 'ib_init_event');

Initialize an event handle from several event names.

=item C<ib_wait_event>

 $dbh->func($evh, 'ib_wait_event');

Wait synchronously for particular events registered via event handle $evh.

=item C<ib_register_callback>

 $dbh->func($evh, sub { print "callback..\n" }, 'ib_register_callback');

Register a callback for asynchronous wait.

=item C<ib_reinit_event>

 $dbh->func($evh, 'ib_reinit_event');

Reinitialize event handle.

=back

=head2 Retrieving Firebird/InterBase specific database information

=over

=item C<ib_database_info>

 $hash_ref = $dbh->func(@info, 'ib_database_info');
 $hash_ref = $dbh->func([@info], 'ib_database_info');

Retrieve information from current database connection. 

=back

=head2 Obsolete Features

=item Private Method

C<set_tx_param()> is obsoleted by C<ib_set_tx_param()>.

=head2 Unsupported SQL Statements

Here is a list of SQL statements which can't be used. But this shouldn't be a 
problem, because their functionality are already provided by the DBI methods.

=over 4

=item * SET TRANSACTION

Use C<$dbh->func(..., 'set_tx_param')> instead.

=item * DESCRIBE

Provides information about columns that are retrieved by a DSQL statement,
or about placeholders in a statement. This functionality is supported by the
driver, and transparent for users. Column names are available via
$sth->{NAME} attributes.

=item * EXECUTE IMMEDIATE

Calling do() method without bind value(s) will do the same.

=item * CLOSE, OPEN, DECLARE CURSOR

$sth->{CursorName} is automagically available upon executing a "SELECT .. FOR
UPDATE" statement. A cursor is closed after the last fetch(), or by calling
$sth->finish(). 

=item * PREPARE, EXECUTE, FETCH

Similar functionalities are obtained by using prepare(), execute(), and 
fetch() methods.

=back

=head2 Compatibility with DBI Extension modules 

C<DBD::InterBase> is known to work with C<DBIx::Recordset> 0.21, and
C<Apache::DBI> 0.87. Yuri Vasiliev <I<yuri.vasiliev@targuscom.com>> reported 
successful usage with Apache::AuthDBI (part of C<Apache::DBI> 0.87 
distribution).

The driver is untested with C<Apache::Session::DBI>. Doesn't work with 
C<Tie::DBI>. C<Tie::DBI> calls $dbh->prepare("LISTFIELDS $table_name") on 
which InterBase fails to parse. I think that the call should be made within 
an eval block.
